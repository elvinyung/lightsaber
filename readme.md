### web based command interface

I got annoyed by having to manually copy form fields to Postman when replaying certain HTTP requests, so I made this super hacky thing that lets you paste cURLS but still have a web based interface to look at results. Also there's kinda placeholders in the form (was that a pun? i dunno) of `%s`.

Super super hacky. oh god why did i do this

holy shit it's 3 AM
